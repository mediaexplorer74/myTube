## About the original
MyTube is the the famous Youtube client / application that using Youtube API from google. Sadly, its WP8 / W10M developing stopped by its developers... and thera are some critial bugs such damaged webbrowser google auth. :(

So, myTube reconstruction is very important thing :) 

## My 2 cents
- Appx Decomp.
- Fast code/architecture research
- WP8 -> W10M code rebase/refactoring - approx. 25% 
- App builded with minimal UI yet
- Min. Win. os build - 14393
